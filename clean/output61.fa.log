Developed by Bui Quang Minh, Nguyen Lam Tung, Olga Chernomor,
Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Host:    vika (AVX2, FMA3, 15 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -s output61.fa --redo
Seed:    782640 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Tue Nov 19 10:51:33 2024
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file output61.fa ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains protein sequences
Alignment has 20 sequences with 59 columns, 56 distinct patterns
